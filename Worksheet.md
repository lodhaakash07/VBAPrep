Absolutely. Let's dive deeper into Excel specifics:

**1. Working with Cells and Ranges:**

A `Range` object represents a cell, a row, a column, a selection of cells containing one or more continuous blocks of cells, or a 3-D range. Here are some examples:

```vba
Dim rng As Range

' Selecting a single cell
Set rng = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1").Range("A1")
rng.Value = "Hello, world!"

' Selecting multiple cells
Set rng = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1").Range("A1:B2")
rng.Value = "Hello, world!"

' Referencing cells relative to other cells
Set rng = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1").Range("A1")
rng.Offset(1, 0).Value = "Hello, world!"  ' This will write "Hello, world!" in cell A2
```

**2. Working with Worksheets:**

The `Worksheet` object represents a worksheet. Here are some examples:

```vba
Dim ws As Worksheet

' Adding a new worksheet
Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Sheets.Add(After:=ThisWorkbook.Sheets(ThisWorkbook.Sheets.Count))
ws.Name = "My New Worksheet"

' Looping through all worksheets
Dim i As Integer
i = 1
For Each ws In ThisWorkbook.Sheets
    ws.Range("A1").Value = "This is sheet number " & i
    i = i + 1
Next ws
```

**3. Working with Workbooks:**

The `Workbook` object represents a workbook. Here are some examples:

```vba
Dim wb As Workbook

' Creating a new workbook
Set wb = Workbooks.Add
wb.SaveAs "C:\temp\myworkbook.xlsx"

' Looping through all workbooks
For Each wb In Application.Workbooks
    Debug.Print wb.Name
Next wb
```

**4. Event Procedures:**

Excel allows you to run code automatically in response to specific events, such as opening a workbook, saving a workbook, changing a cell, etc. Here are some examples:

```vba
' This code goes in the ThisWorkbook module
Private Sub Workbook_Open()
    MsgBox "This workbook has been opened."
End Sub

' This code goes in a worksheet module
Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)
    If Not Intersect(Target, Me.Range("A1")) Is Nothing Then
        MsgBox "Cell A1 has been changed."
    End If
End Sub
```

**5. Working with Excel Objects:**

Excel provides a lot of other objects that can be manipulated with VBA, such as `Chart`, `PivotTable`, `QueryTable`, `Shape`, `Comment`, etc. Here's an example with `Chart`:

```vba
' Creating a chart
Dim rng As Range
Dim cht As Chart
Set rng = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1").Range("A1:B5")
Set cht = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1").Shapes.AddChart2(251, xlColumnClustered, 100, 100, 300, 200).Chart
cht.SetSourceData Source:=rng
```

These are just a few examples. Excel provides a rich set of objects and collections that can be manipulated with VBA to create powerful and complex applications.
