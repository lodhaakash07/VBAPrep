Absolutely! Here are some examples of control structures in VBA:

**1. If...ElseIf...Else:**

This structure tests conditions in order, and once one condition is met, the rest are skipped.

```vba
Dim score As Integer
score = 85

If score >= 90 Then
    MsgBox "A"
ElseIf score >= 80 Then
    MsgBox "B"
ElseIf score >= 70 Then
    MsgBox "C"
Else
    MsgBox "F"
End If
```

**2. Select Case:**

This is similar to If...ElseIf...Else, but it's usually cleaner when testing one variable against multiple values.

```vba
Dim score As Integer
score = 85

Select Case score
    Case Is >= 90
        MsgBox "A"
    Case Is >= 80
        MsgBox "B"
    Case Is >= 70
        MsgBox "C"
    Case Else
        MsgBox "F"
End Select
```

**3. For...Next:**

This structure repeats a block of statements a certain number of times.

```vba
Dim i As Integer
For i = 1 To 5
    Debug.Print i  ' Prints the numbers 1 through 5 to the Immediate Window
Next i
```

**4. For Each...Next:**

This structure repeats a block of statements for each element in an array or collection.

```vba
Dim ws As Worksheet
For Each ws In ThisWorkbook.Sheets
    Debug.Print ws.Name  ' Prints the name of each worksheet in the workbook
Next ws
```

**5. Do...Loop:**

This structure repeats a block of statements while a condition is true, or until a condition becomes true.

```vba
Dim i As Integer
i = 1
Do While i <= 5
    Debug.Print i  ' Prints the numbers 1 through 5 to the Immediate Window
    i = i + 1
Loop
```

**6. While...Wend:**

This structure is similar to Do While...Loop, but it's less flexible and it's not recommended to use it as it may be removed from future versions of VBA.

```vba
Dim i As Integer
i = 1
While i <= 5
    Debug.Print i  ' Prints the numbers 1 through 5 to the Immediate Window
    i = i + 1
Wend
```

These are the basic control structures in VBA. Of course, these can be nested and combined in complex ways to create more complicated algorithms and code structures.
